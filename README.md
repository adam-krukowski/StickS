"Sticks" is an app for dog owners to find nearby parks and dog-friendly places. Right now, the map is working and shows different locations for dog owners to check out. The app has a list of parks like Hyde Park, Regent's Park, and Victoria Park, which are added to the database to get started. In the future, I plan to add features like sorting parks, showing different ones based on your needs, and letting users leave reviews.
